In PHP, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with variable scope within nested functions or closures. Consider a scenario where an inner function attempts to access or modify a variable defined in its parent function's scope.  If the inner function attempts to modify a variable from the outer scope without using the `&` (reference) operator, a copy of the variable is passed.  Any changes within the inner function won't affect the original variable in the outer scope. This behavior can be unexpected and lead to incorrect results.
